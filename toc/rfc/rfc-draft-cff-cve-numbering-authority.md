- Name: CFF CVE Numbering Authority
- Start Date: 2024-01-25

## Summary

For the last several years the CFF has relied on sponsoring member VMWare as the CVE numbering authority.  When we have needed to publish a CVE, we claim a CVE number from their reservation block.  

This responsibility should lie with the foundation itself.

## Problem

CVE must be published in a timely fashion.  Any interruptions in the allocation of a CVE number, pre-disclosure or disclosure puts installations and their Users are at risk.

## Proposal

Establish Cloud Foundry Foundation as a CVE Numbering Authority managing its own block of CVE numbers.
