# 2022 CFF TOC Election Guide


## Overview


Each year, the CFF technical community holds an election for open seats on the 
Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). The rules governing this election are set in the 
[CFF's project charter](../../../governing-board/charter.md) (See section 7(b) and 7(e)
for the relevant details).


This guide exists to serve as a guide to this year's election process.

## Candidate Processes


**Nominations**


Every eligible voter can nominate candidates for the TOC, and we encourage you to do so. If you are 
eligible to serve on the TOC, you can self nominate! If you want to nominate someone else, do so as 
well! 


You can nominate someone for the TOC by [submitting an issue using this template](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=election&template=toc-candidate-nomination.md&title=TOC+Candidate+Nomination+for+%5BPerson+Name%5D). 


The deadline is June 2nd to be nominated (and for the nominee to indicate acceptance).


It is strongly recommended that you confirm that a nominee is interested and willing
to accept the nomination prior to submitting the nomination issue.


**Confirming Nominee Eligibility**


Once a nomination is received, the CFF staff will contact the nominee to confirm acceptance
of the nomination. If the nominee accepts, they will be added to the list of nominees at the bottom
of this file. The nomination issue will be closed, noting if the nominee accepted or declined the 
nomination.


## Voting Process


The election will be conducted using [Elekto](https://elekto.dev/), a voting application hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. 

Please review voting eligibility requirements [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/TOC.md). All eligible voters will be able to vote after authenticating with their GitHub login, once the election begins. 


## Election Results


The newly elected body will be announced via cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org on 22 Jun, 2022.


Following the announcement, the voting results and winners will be published.
